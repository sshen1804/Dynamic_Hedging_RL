# Dynamic Replication and Hedging: A Reinforcement Learning Approach

Dynamic Option Hedging constitutes a fundamental problem in finance since the seminal work of Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM). However, the traditional assumptions of perfect markets – frictionless trading and continuous-time operations – prove unrealistic in practice. The studied paper proposes an innovative approach using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize hedging strategies under more realistic conditions incorporating discrete time, transaction costs, and liquidity constraints.

The key contributions of this research are threefold:

Generic Framework: The authors develop a versatile method for training autonomous agents to find the optimal balance between cost minimization and variance reduction.
Continuous State Spaces: Their RL approach effectively handles continuous state spaces, thereby overcoming the notorious curse of dimensionality.
Empirical Results: Demonstrated significant reduction in transaction costs without material degradation of volatility performance.
